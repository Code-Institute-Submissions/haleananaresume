<h1>Hale Anana - Resume </h1>

I wanted to create a resume website to:
<ul>
<li> Showcase my skill and how its applied </li>
<li> Attract potential employers </li>
<li> To potentially collaborate with other web designers on cool and exciting project</li>
</ul>

<h2> UX </h2>
As I've mentioned, this website is mainly targeted at potential employers. I focused on something simple and easy to navigate but made sure that it showcases what I'm capable of visually and technically.

During my research of what a good online resume should present, I found the following:

<ul>

<li> Simple and easy to navigate</li>
<li> Just  the right amount of information </li>
<li> Colour scheme should be pleasing and should not contradict</li>
<li> Uniformity of fonts, colours and themes</li>
</ul>

Putting myself in the employers position, I would probably go with the "less is more" approach.
The webpage has all the information that a potential employer/collaborator needs.

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Existing Features</h3>

In this current version, my main feature is the collapsable navigation bar. All content of the website will scale to whatever device the user is viewing it on.
The navbar background when viewed on smaller screen was initially visually unappealing so I made sure that when scaled to smaller screens, the navbar background disappears and blends in the photo.


<h3>Features Left to Implement</h3>
I would like to add a "Portofolio" page once I have enough projects to showcase.
I also intend to add animated feautures once I become proficient at JS ,Python and etc.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML- To create the structure of the website.</li>
<li>CSS - To add styles and make my website visually appealing.</li>
<li>Bootstrap- Provides ready to use and visually appealing classes for convenience. Saves a lot of time. </li>
<li>Figma- To create the wireframe of my website.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing </h2>

Below are the following scenarios that has been tested:

<h3>Contact form</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tried to submit without an email address entered and it came back with an error message to notify users that email is required.</li>
<li>Tried to submit with an invalid email and it came back with an error message to notify that valid email is required.</li>
<li>Submitted with all input correctly filled and submission was a success.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Responsiveness</h3>
<ul>
<li>I tested content alignment on different screen sizes and everything aligns the way I want it to align.</li>
<li>I tested to see if content I set to disappear during smaller screen sizes are working and found them to be working as intended.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Nav links</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tested nav links to make sure they direct to the correct section of the website.</li>
</ul>

<h3> General HTML and CSS </h3>
<ul>
<li>Ran html and css code using html and css checker. Came back with no errors found.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Possible bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>During responsiveness testing, the content seem to have a right margin on the smaller screen. This disappears when you change screensizes multiple times.</li>
</ul>

Update: Fixed this issue by setting margin left and right to 0. 



<h3>Deployment</h3>

Deployed using Githubpages and deployed directly from the master branch. My website should update automatically upon new commits to the master branch.
